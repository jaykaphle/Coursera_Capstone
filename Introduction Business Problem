Introduction

New York City is multicultural, the largest city and the financial hub of the USA. An international restaurant chain AAA wants to know the best location to open its first restaurant in New York.  AAA sells spicy dumplings with 3 different levels of hotness.

New York has more than 1.2 million Asian population: Chinese, Filipino, Korean and Japanese (total 949 K) including 315K South Asians. Since most of the Asian people are familiar with the dumplings, the dumplings from the company AAA tastes different than what is served in other Asian countries. AAA believes once people get the taste of its dumplings, they will love them and convert to its regular customers. In addition, certain percentage of people from other culture who like international food will also become its customer as well.

Objective 

In this project, I will study in detail using segmentation and clustering to answer following business question:
Best location to open the restaurant:
-	Highest Asian population â€“ they are familiar with the dumpling without any spices, boiled in water. They are expected to like the spicy dumplings once they eat it. 
-	Highest South Asian population since they are familiar with the taste of the spices used in the dumplings.
