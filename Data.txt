Data

I will be using Wikipedia data for New York City.
	1. New York population
	2. New York demographics
	3. List of New York locations by per capita income
	4. Foursquare API
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_locations_by_per_capita_income
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_New_York_City
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Michelin_starred_restaurants_in_New_York_City
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_New_York_City

	• Population and demographics data will be used to find the locations with highest number of Asian immigrants. 
	• Per capita income will be used to further narrow down the location with high income so that they can dine out frequently, and expectation is they can make multiple 	dining in the restaurant per week. 
	• Foursquare data will be used to find the location with higher number of Asian cousins, which in conjunction with high per capita income will help to determine the 	location to open the restaurant.

Methodology

This will include the following components of the analysis…
	1. Get Data
	2. EDA to understand the data
	3. Data wrangling/preprocessing and preparation
	4. Modeling/segmentation and clustering
	5. Review/modify the model as needed.
